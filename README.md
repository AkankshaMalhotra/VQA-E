# Visual QA Assistance for Visual Impairment

- In this project we combined the ```VQA v2``` and the ```VQA-E``` dataset to create a custom ```VQA-EI``` dataset that aims to train 
and provide two modalities of explanations for the model output.
- We reported 70% accuracy on the answer predictions using GRU model using Glove embedding, and a ResNet152 pre-trained network for the 
image embeddings, for 20 epochs and 1000 data points.
